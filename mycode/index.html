            <p>All of my code is formatted neatly for the sake of open source use. Whether you are
                using a JavaScript snippet, some Python code, or an entire Java project, the internal
                comments make it easy to identify what the code is used for.</p>
            
            <h2>My Header</h2>
            <p>On every file on all of my projects, you will see my header. This header serves to identify
                the code as mine, provide info on when it was last edited, as well as inform the viewer of
                their rights and limitations for manipulating my code. The header looks as follows.</p>

            <h2>Licensing</h2>
            <p>I am a firm believer in open-source. I have learned a great many things by looking at someone else's 
                code to see how they accomplished a task. While all of my projects are open-source, and available on GitHub,
                some projects have restrictions on how you can use the code in them. The individual licenses for each project
                are linked in each project file, however, you can view the licenses <a href="/mycode/licenses">here.</a></p>

                repositories. All the code is subject to its respective licenses. <a href="http://github.com/glmills">Go to GitHub</a></p>
